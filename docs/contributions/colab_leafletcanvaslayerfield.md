# Leaflet.CanvasLayer.Field

**About**

Leaflet.CanvasLayer.Field is a plugin for LeafletJS that adds one or multiple layers to visualize fields (aka Rasters) from ASCIIGrid or GeoTIFF files on web maps.

Official repo: [IHCantabria/Leaflet.CanvasLayer.Field](https://github.com/IHCantabria/Leaflet.CanvasLayer.Field).

**My contribution**

1. Implemented a built-in component for controlling the animation as a conventional player (LayersPlayer).
2. Included [example of implementation](https://github.com/IHCantabria/Leaflet.CanvasLayer.Field/blob/master/docs/example_LayersPlayer.html).
