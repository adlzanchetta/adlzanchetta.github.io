# Raven Framework

**About**

Raven is a hydrologic modelling framework very popular among operational teams and academics in Canada, implemented and maintained by Prof. James Craig and his team at the University of Waterloo.

Official repo: [CSHS-CWRA/RavenHydroFramework](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenHydroFramework).

**My contributions**

1. Supported the implementation of the Basic Model Interface (BMI) interface;
2. Replaced global variables by local variables for parallelization in BMI frameworks (refactoring).

**Tech stack**

- C++;
- Makefiles.
