Andre D. L. Zanchetta (a.k.a. *adlzanchetta*) is a full-stack software engineer with more than 10 years in the world of web development. He looks forward to facing new challenges and staying updated with cutting-edge technologies. Currently, he is a collaborator at NModes, a company specialized in developing chatbots and solutions involving natural language processing (NLP).

Andre holds a Ph.D. degree in Hydroinformatics from McMaster University (Canada) and a Masterâ€™s degree in the same field from The University of Iowa (USA). During his postgraduate programs, he delved into various computational technologies, focusing on data visualization and machine learning to model, forecast, and communicate critical hydrological phenomena like floods.

Fluent in multiple programming languages including Javascript, Python, Java, C, C++, PHP, Bash, and more, Andre can effortlessly communicate with computers. He is also multilingual with proficiency in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and is currently improving his French.

When not in front of the computer, Andre can be found riding his bicycle, walking some trail, in an online game, or watching some blockbuster or well-unknown movie. He values a good sense of humor and the habit of continuous learning. By the way, he is, at this exact moment, trying to improve his skills in writing about himself in the third person."
